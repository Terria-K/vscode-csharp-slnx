# slnx-vscode-csharp

This is a "fork" of [free-vscode-csharp](https://github.com/muhammadsammy/free-vscode-csharp) by muhammadsammy which
provides a slnx support which is the newer and better format for sln 
([more information right here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-slnx-support-dotnet-cli/)) since
the free extension does not provide the support for it, even the MS one. 

This just apply necessary patches to support slnx and published it as an artifacts from Github Actions. This also
runs daily and provides you an up-to-date free-vscode-csharp vsix. You can download the latest artifact
